# genalgo
My first try in genetic algorithms in Java 8 with Maven.

If you're interested:

"Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a search-based optimization technique based on the principles of
Genetics and Natural Selection. It is frequently used to find optimal or near-optimal solutions
to difficult problems which otherwise would take a lifetime to solve. It is frequently used to solve
optimization problems, in research, and in machine learning."

This java program is looking for the TARGET string using natural selection.
